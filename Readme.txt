Ikaika Lee and Adam Dupuy

For this project we did our best to implement the code in Grm.cup.  We couldn't
find a test file for the program but believe it should work for the most part.
We implemented the code using your UML diagrams from moodle. We tried not to focus
too much on error recoveries to save time and due to a lack of understanding. Going
off of what you said in lecture we avoided left recursion and tried to implement right
recursion to the best of our ability. Due to the lack of test file we are not sure what
works and what does not and were unable to optimize our grammar due to the same reasons.

Overall this was very hard for us and our lack of testing ability made it even harder.
We hope to have a better understanding for the next project and hopefully can code it
in a more efficient and complete manner.
